# CTGAN Running Instructions

Code for running the synthetic data generation experiments from https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN.

Workflow:
- 'CTGAN_Thesis.ipynb' - This notebook creates and saves the CTGAN synthesizer, which can be used to generate synthetic datasets. 
- 'ctgan_synthesizer.pkl' - This is the CTGAN synthesizer created for the Czech transactions dataset with the hyperparameters specified in Table 5 of the thesis paper.
