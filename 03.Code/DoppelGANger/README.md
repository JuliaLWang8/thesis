# DoppelGANger Running Instructions

Code for running the synthetic data generation experiments from https://github.com/fjxmlzn/DoppelGANger.git. Hyperparameters for training can be found in Table 5 of the thesis paper. 

Workflow:
- 'training' folder contains code used for the training of the model itself, run the file 'main.py'. 
- 'generating_data' folder contains code to run after the model has been trained to generate synthetic data, run the file 'main_generate_data.py'.
